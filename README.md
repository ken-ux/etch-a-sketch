# etch-a-sketch

Creates a grid of squares that changes to a random color when the mouse moves over them. A button on the page allows the user to input a new number of squares per side that will populate the grid. The overall grid size remains static even when the number of squares changes.

While using CSS grid would've seemed more appropriate, this project was an exercise in using only a flexbox layout and DOM manipulation to form a dynamic grid.
